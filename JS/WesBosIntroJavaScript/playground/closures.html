    //----------Example Closure Creating a Function----------
    //Closures--the ability to access a parent level scope from a child scope even
    //after that parent function has been terminated

    //child access higher level parent scope even after the function has be
    //called or closed


    function outer() {
      const outerVar = 'Hey I am the outer Var!';
      function inner() {
        const innerVar = 'Hey I am the inner Var!';
        console.log(innerVar);
        console.log(outerVar);
      }
      // inner();
      return inner;
    }
    // outer();
    //Here you can stick a function into a variable, and at a later time you
    //have access to that inner function
    const innerFn = outer();
    innerFn(); //this is a closure,
    //and it is an example of a closure creating a function

    // so the outer function is run and remains in memory closed
    //but we can access it by putting it in a variale and use it at a
    //later time.

    //This is helpful in the following ways





    //----------Example Closure Creating Private Variables----------
    function createGreeting(greeting = '') {
      const myGreet = greeting.toUpperCase();
      return function (name) {
        return `${myGreet} ${name}`; // here our inner scope references
        //a variable that is in our outer scope 'myGreet'
      }
    }
    const sayHello = createGreeting('Hello');
    const sayHey = createGreeting('Hi');
    console.log(sayHello('wes'));
    console.log(sayHello('kate'));
    console.log(sayHey('kate'));


    function createGame(gameName) {
      let score = 0;
      return function win() {
        score++;
        return `Your name ${gameName} score is ${score}`;
      }
    }
    //This is helpful because the inner function
    //increments each time the game is run and since it is
    //an inner function  you can creat multiple games for this fucntion
    //and the increments are seperate between games.
    const hockeyGame = createGame('Hockey');
    const soccerGame = createGame('Soccer');
    //Essentially each of these has their own private variable called score
